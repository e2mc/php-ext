**Main memory APIs**

| Prototype   |  Description  | 
|---|---|
| void *emalloc(size_t size)  |  Allocate size bytes of memory. | 
|void *ecalloc(size_t nmemb, size_t size)|	 Allocate a buffer for nmemb elements of size bytes and makes sure it is initialized with zeros.|
|void *erealloc(void *ptr, size_t size)	| Resize the buffer ptr, which was allocated using emalloc to hold size bytes of memory.|
|void efree(void *ptr)	| Free the buffer pointed by ptr. The buffer had to be allocated by emalloc.|
|void *safe_emalloc(size_t nmemb, size_t size, size_t offset)|	 Allocate a buffer for holding nmemb blocks of each size bytes and an additional offset bytes. This is similar to emalloc(nmemb * size + offset) but adds a special protection against overflows.|
|char *estrdup(const char *s)|	 Allocate a buffer that can hold the NULL-terminated string s and copy the s into that buffer.|
|char *estrndup(const char *s, unsigned int length)|	 Similar to estrdup while the length of the NULL-terminated string is already known.|


**Persistent memory APIs**

|Prototype	|Description|
|---|---|
|void *pemalloc(size_t size, zend_bool persistent)|	Allocate size bytes of memory.|
|void *pecalloc(size_t nmemb, size_t size, zend_bool persistent)|	 Allocate a buffer for nmemb elements of size bytes and makes sure it is initialized with zeros.|
|void *perealloc(void *ptr, size_t size, zend_bool persistent)|	 Resize the buffer ptr, which was allocated using emalloc to hold size bytes of memory.|
|void pefree(void *ptr, zend_bool persistent)|	 Free the buffer pointed by ptr. The buffer had to be allocated by pemalloc.|
|void *safe_pemalloc(size_t nmemb, size_t size, size_t offset, zend_bool persistent)|	 Allocate a buffer for holding nmemb blocks of each size bytes and an additional offset bytes. This is similar to pemalloc(nmemb * size + offset) but adds a special protection against overflows.|
|char *pestrdup(const char *s, zend_bool persistent)|	 Allocate a buffer that can hold the NULL-terminated string s and copy the s into that buffer.|
|char *pestrndup(const char *s, unsigned int length, zend_bool persistent)|	 Similar to pestrdup while the length of the NULL-terminated string is already known.|
